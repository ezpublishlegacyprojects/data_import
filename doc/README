Extension : data_import
Requires  : eZ Publish 4.0.0

Summary   :
The purpose of that extension is to import data from a
given data source (like xml/csv documents) into the eZ
Publish content tree. This extension is under the GPL.

Concepts :
We choose a object oririented approach. Developers need to
implement a SourceHandler that understands the given data
source. The handler is completely independent from the
import operators. The import operators contain the logic
how to create/update the content nodes in eZ Publish.

Import Process :
Each import process starts with an eZ cronjob script. That
script only get an instance of a SourceHandler and an
ImportOperator. It then runs the ImportOperator.

Get started :
Here a quick description how to get started with that
extension - so you can decide if it usefull to you.
