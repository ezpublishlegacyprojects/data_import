The data import extension allows to import HTML into eZ Publish
XML Block data types. It uses a standard eZ Publish handler to
translate the given HTML into the XML format of XML Block data
type ( PHP class eZSimplifiedXMLInputParser in
kernel/classes/datatypes/ezxmltext/handlers/input/ezsimplifiedxmlinputparser.php ) 

Here an example, the handler ( XML input parser ) translate the
HTML "p" tag into the XML tag "paragraph".

In case the standard eZ Publish handler doesn't provide all needed
functionality, you are able to use a custom handler. To enable a
custom handler, you have to override the function "get_ezxml_handler"
from the "SourceHandler" PHP class. It is a good idea to start of
the standard handler when developing a custom one.
